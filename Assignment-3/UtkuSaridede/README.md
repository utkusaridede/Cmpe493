I have used python 3.4 as a programming language. So that, in order to run the script having
newest python (3.4.x) version is a must.

($ python3.4 assignment3.py)

How to use?

- Please give the file name at the same directory with script: 
 ~ < INPUT FILE FROM SAME DIRECTORY >

Script wants a file name from same path with script.
